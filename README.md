# Project Details

A online class I did over winter break just for fun to learn how to use Javascript, learn the syntax, and create a first draft of a personal website/resume.

##Udacity Course: Javascript Basics

In this course, you'll explore the JavaScript programming language by creating an interactive version of your résumé. You’ll learn the JavaScript programming fundamentals you need while building new elements and sections to enhance your résumé.
